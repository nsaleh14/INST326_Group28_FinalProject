This is documentation for weather_app.py.


Weather App:

This program is for a weather app using the api from openweathermap.org.

The user will be able to create an account and sign in, then they will be able to acess weather data using latitude and longitude and the date they want data for.
If a user wants past weather data for research, they can enter a past date, but if they just want the current forecast, they can enter the current date and get the forecast for the week.


Running the program:

To run it, just enter the program's file name.

After running it, you will see three options printed in the output: 1. Sign Up, and 2. Sign In, and 3. Exit. Then it will tell you to choose one of the options.

In order to do so, just enter the number next to whichever option you want to access. (NOTE: Entering 3 will end the program.)

To start, choose sign up by entering the number "1". You will be prompted to enter a username, then a password. Enter whatever text you would like these to be.

After you successfully create an account, you will be brought back to the previous output after being told to sign in.

Enter the number "2" for Sign In. You will be prompted to enter the username, then the password, that you had created.

After successfully signing in, you will see two options printed: "1. Check Weather", and "2. Log Out". (NOTE: Entering 2 will end the program.)

Enter the number "1" to access weather data.
After doing so, you will be prompted to enter the latitude for your chosen area first. The latitude and longitude are in a "float" format.
Example: 38.989697

After entering the latitude, you will be prompted to enter the longitude. Enter your chosen float, then you will be prompted to enter a date.

This date is in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format, meaning year-month-day. Enter these as numbers. Example: 2017-06-24

If your date is the current date, you will see printed output for a weather forecast of the week (seven days).
If your date is a date in the past, you will see weather data for that past date instead.

After this output, you will be brought back to the output where the options are "1. Check Weather" and "2. Log Out". You can again choose either option by entering the numbers "1" or "2".

If you would like to check another date for weather information, you can enter "1" and be prompted again as you were before. Otherwise, if you would like to end the program you can enter the number "2".

Thank you for checking out our app!
